I decided to go with python here even though I find myself stronger in Java, it is just better for these situations. For exact_change.py you can just run it in the terminal, it takes user input and outputs the exact change needed. I believe it is O(1) time complexity even though there is a for loop it only iterates through the length of cents. I started by making individual variables for each amount but then realized it would be too difficult to continuously add higher dollar amounts so I decided to go with a list. The for loop uses modulo and iterates through the list constantly dividing and adding info to a print statement. Getting the test cases to work was a bit off a pain. I started off trying to find ways to mock user input but decided it would be easier to just make a second method that takes a parameter. I used unittest so if you plan on using the test cases you need that. The test case just test a normal amount, an amount of zero and a large amount. Thank You.
