I decided to go with Python here even though I find myself stronger in Java; it is just better for these situations. For exact_change.py you can just run it in the terminal, it takes user input and outputs the exact change needed. This is O(1) complexity as the for loop iterates through the predetermined currency loop. I started by making individual variables for each amount. Still, I then realized it would be too difficult to continuously add higher dollar amounts so I decided to go with a list. The for loop uses modulo and iterates through the list, constantly dividing and adding info to a print statement. Getting the test cases to work was a bit of a pain. I started off trying to find ways to mock user input but decided it would be easier to just make a second method that takes a parameter. I used unittest so if you plan on using the test cases you need that. The test case just tests a normal amount, an amount of zero, and a large amount. Thank You.
